/*
Mr. Alan, the professor in computer science, gives an assignment to his student 
Mark. He gives a list of values and ask Mark to sort the list based on the 
number of oneâ€™s in the binary representation of each value. If there are more 
than one value which has same number of oneâ€™s, the sorting for those values, 
should be in the original order of list. 
Your task is to help Mark in his task. 

Note: Each value in the list will be in the range of 1 to 10000.

Sample test case
